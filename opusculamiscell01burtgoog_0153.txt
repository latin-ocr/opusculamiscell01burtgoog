[ '135 .]

’rach ωε to· we 'ana atet tte thee serene
And unappall’d to view th’ atnazing scene,³ ’ ”
With thee tan verge os hist, thy Pispah, stand ’
At nearet distance from the promis'd land:
Look down with scorn upon this mrthiy Ball:
Whete now is all, which good or great we call?
All all is vanity, vexation all!
Our wisdom folly, and our pleasure pain: ’
Thy sweetest Mufick too, my friend, is vain.
1 hear the Royall Preachet, and with {hamt ’
Refle& on what I do, atid what Ῑ am.
More happy Thou in th’ evening of thy day,
Refin’d byfickness, strengthen'd by decay. Ι ·
Death ia become familiar to thy sight:
Ita horrors vaniih at the dawn of light. 4
A Christian's life is daily thus, to die:
Thia the soul'a triumph 0'et mortality.

Who then sstou’d grieve? yet grieveI t‘ttust, at mant

David bewail’d the fall of Jonatban.
A sorrowful complacency it is

To count what once we lov'd, what now we miss.

I’ll sooth my grief, and write thy Epitaph ε ·-·

Omay’st thou tead it‘some years henc‘ee- and laugh ’1

Enjoy
