[14³]

Afreffi inculcatam th’ awak'en’d mind, ’
And bide-me fflconvzffiony md with thee,
Ο Royal Poeaeher, search sor tr‘uths divine,
And Proverb's in 'example realiz'd:

Look down ,on human life, amotly scene, ¹

Solemn immineam, awaki'ng dream,

And all our cares,' ali, but Religion, vain Ι

0 may that sp'rit corre& my wandring sense, ²

Reform the Brute and seinstate the Man,

In anthe dignityof intellest, ’ . ’

And teach me wisdom! to my reason-eye, Ν

As in prismatick glast, distinffly (hew

The pure anblended forme of Good and ΙΙΙ, ·
stript of the gay confufion which deludes

Th' unwary sight. Teach me to look on life · ¹

W

Ι know the heavenly temper of my Mind:

But ’tis corrupted both in wit and will.

1 know my Soul ha power to know all things,

Yet is ihc blind and ignorant in all: ,

1 know rin one of Names ntae nugs,

Yet to the ΙειΙΙ and'vilest things am thrallz

1 know my lift'a a pain, ancl buta span:

Ι how my sense is meck⁰d in every things -
⁴ And to conclude, 1 know myself a Man,

which iu min, and yet ff wtetched thing.
