⁶ The following verses are taken eut of Sir J. Davils poem on the In·
⁴ mortality of the soei, written in 159², dedicated ω Qsserurerr.

Yet if Afflielion once ner ware begin, ‚ r

And threat the feebler sense with sword and fine,

The Miud eontra& herself, end sterinktth in,
ι . And to herself {he gladly deth retire. .

As Spiders touch'd seek the Webs inmost part:

Ae Beee in stoma back to their hiwee return:

Ae blood in danger gathers to the heart:

As rnen seek towns when foen the country burn.
lf aught ean teech us aught‚ Afflistion's looks,
Making us pry into ourselves so near,
- 'resch us to know ourselves beyond ellboebn, '
Or all the learned schools that ever were.
This Mistrel'r lately pluek’d nne by the Ean· ’
And many agolden leffon heth me taught: Ι
Hath made my Senses quick, end R'eason clear,
Refotm’d my Wili, end rarified my Thougnt. y

So do the storms and thunders purge the eir:

So working scas {etde and purge the wine:

Sir lopp’d aad pruned trees reflourisn sein

So doth the fire the drossy gold nenne.

Neither Μίνωα, nor the learned Mese,

Nor eules of art, nor precepts of the wisc,

Cou'd in my bnain those beams of nin infuse,

As but the glauce ostris Dame's wgry εγω·

she within lists my ranging mind hes brought⁸

That now beyond myself 1 will net go:

Myself arn center· of my circling thought,
Onlylrnyself 1 study, learn and know.

Iknow my Body ef so frail ekind, ,
As force without, severe within may kin:
