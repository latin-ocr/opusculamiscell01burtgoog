[ 141 ·]
Polly thy wit, thy pleasure vanity‚
Thy mirth vexatiom - soe..with sutehssow pace '
A Magdalene, with sels-condemning ¹⁰⁰k?
And scourge of chastisement, comes Penitence‚

Handmaidof wisdom, hight Sophrosyne3

Sage Mistress‚ who, reclus: from vulgar ken,

Shuns noise and sport, and in pure intelle&

Surveys th’ unbodied forms of Ttue and Good, “

And in just balance weighs the moral world.
Thee, Royal Preacher‚ her degenerate son,

She, plucking by the ear, from* moral death ’

Reclaim‘d, and many a golden leffon taught;

Taught thee to know thyself, to know the world,
Know all is vanity, vexation all.

Ofav’rite child of Nature, Fortune, Gracc, ’

Let Sheba’s Qeen admire thy regal pomp, Ν ’

And Fame extol] thy philosophick wit;

But let me praise thy heav'n·enlighten'd mind
In the contempt of Greatness truly great z
Onot in all thy glory so rever’d,·

As in this solemn penitentia} state,

This triumph of thy reason over sense,

0 Salomon, now wisest of= the wife!
⁴· · ’ Dear·
