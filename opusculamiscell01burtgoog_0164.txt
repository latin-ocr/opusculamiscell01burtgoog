The Siren voice of Pleasure, Fairy·Qeen‚” g
Enchantress of the world: who holds her Court

· In Towrr, arrd Country, Theaters, and Groves‚

Vauxrhall, and Ranelagh 3 where m‘erry foole
Frelick and laugh, oncenscious ,ef their. fate.

Mistress of penitential discipline] δ ,-

With frowrring espech and1 reflested eye, ’

Come reinrigorate the mental 'powerej ·

And speak thy leffon te my purge'd ear,¹

A leffon, sweeter than the Siren's songr 'f . ὁ
Refine my thoughts* anfi lift the souluto' heaven ς
O strew me to myself, 'shew what is life, ⁵
