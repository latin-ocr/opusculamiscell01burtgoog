To a Friend at Rath.

1· ro neni.  

LI F E ol this mortal life, all-chearlng Henlth,
Thon· spring‘eternal through the wintry year,

Thou sunlhine through this little world of Man r
Or heat'st thou rather, jolly Mountnin·Nymph,¹
Daughter ol ·Tempettnce and F ortitude, , .
With rosy·tinnur'd cheek and sparkling eye,
Immortal youth tnd never-fading blooml
Sole friend of p‘overty‚ unbrib’d by walth,
Mysterious Guestl when present, scarce perceiv¹d ι
When lost, most valued: then in vain recall'd j
With sacrifice of many a Prayer, and '1² ent
Hither Ο come with vig'rous graceful step, ⁶
Lend up the merry dnnce, and with thee bring
The Qeen of Lovee and all her sportlve ‘frain'
The gay Destre, which brightens'Hebe’s eye, ·
The sanguine joy-anticipating Hope, ,
